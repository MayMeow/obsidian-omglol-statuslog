### Using

You can use the ribbon icon by clicking on it, or open the command palette with `CTRL+P` (Windows) or a similar keyboard shortcut, depending on your operating system. Find for `Post to status log ðŸ¤£` action.

- If text is selected, it will be posted to the status log.
- If no text is selected, the entry (actual) document content is posted.

I tested plugin on Android and (iOS is will be simmilar) and best with what I came out is add mentioned action above to quick action `settings > mobila > configure quick actions`
